    "1. Create a folder called `Vacation_Search` to save all the files related with this deliverable.\n",

    "2. Download the `Vacation_Search_starter_code.ipynb` Jupyter notebook,save it into your `Vacation_Search folder`, and rename it as `Vacation_Search.ipynb`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. In the `Vacation_Search.ipynb` file, ensure that the dependencies and the Google API key is imported correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. From the `Weather_Database` folder you created in the \"Deliverable 1,\" import the `WeatherPy_Database.csv` file as a Pandas DataFrame named `city_data_df`.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Write two input statements that prompt the user to enter their minimum and maximum temperature criteria for their vacation.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Create a new Pandas DataFrame by using the `loc` Pandas method to filter the `city_data_df` DataFrame for temperature criteria  collected. Name the DataFrame as `preferred_cities_df`.\n",

    "7. Create a new Pandas DataFrame named `clean_travel_cities` by using the Pandas `dropna` function on the `preferred_cities_df` to drop any empty rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Use the `copy` Pandas function to create a new DataFrame, called `hotel_df`, by copying the following columns from the `clean_travel_cities` DataFrame: \"City\", \"Country\", \"Max Temp\", \"Current Description\", \"Lat\", \"Lng\".\n",

    "11. Use a for loop to iterate through the `hotel_df` DataFrame, retrieve the latitude and longitude of each city to find the nearest hotel based on the search parameters provided, then add the hotel name to the `hotel_df` DataFrame. If a hotel isn't found, skip to the next city.\n",

    "15. Review the provided list comprehension code to retrieve the city data from each row, which will then be added to the formatting template and saved in the `hotel_info` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Use the provided code snippet to retrieve the latitude and longitude from each row and store them in a new DataFrame called `locations`.\n",
